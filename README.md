ROCK PAPER SCISSOR VIA JAVASCRIPT IN AN HTML FILE

Had to google and learn about querySelection, textContext, getElementID, createElement, document, and setAttribute.

Struggled a little with the RPS logic but eventually figure it out after working it out while eating.

Finished assignment, struggled with some of the coding related to querySelection and textContext of certain items. Turns out it was a spelling error.
